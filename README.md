# utm-network-security-framework
Final year project – UTM security system for enterprise network (Catalyst International)

 📄 Project Overview

This project delivers a comprehensive **Unified Threat Management (UTM)** system tailored for **Catalyst International (PVT) Ltd**, a website design and development company facing severe network inefficiencies and security challenges. With a growing user base and increased data processing demands, the project aims to create a secure, adaptive, and scalable enterprise network using advanced virtualization and network design tools.

 🧰 Technologies Used

- 🖥️ **VMware Workstation** – Virtualized multi-system environment
- 🌐 **Cisco Packet Tracer** – Enterprise-grade network topology design
- 🛡 **Firewall (Cisco ASA)** – Perimeter security and traffic control
- 🧠 **Security Onion** – Intrusion Detection and SIEM
- 🧪 **Snort** / **Suricata** – IDS/IPS engine for real-time threat detection
- 🐧 **Tiny Core Linux** – Lightweight Linux OS for endpoint testing
- 📡 **VPN** – Encrypted secure remote access configuration


 🔑 Key Features

- 🔄 **VLAN-based Segmentation**: Department-wise network isolation for access control
- 🛡 **Firewall Configuration**: Rules, ACLs, and NAT to control and monitor traffic
- 🧠 **Real-Time IDS/IPS**: Threat detection using Suricata/Snort rulesets
- 🧾 **Centralized SIEM Logging**: Attack and log correlation via Security Onion
- 🔐 **VPN Access**: Secure encrypted tunnels for remote access
- 🧪 **Attack Simulation**: Tested resilience via simulated threats using Kali Linux

 🧪 Testing & Evaluation

- Simulated attacks using Nmap, Hydra, and other Kali Linux tools
- Monitored alerts from SIEM dashboards
- Evaluated network performance and threat response
- Verified VPN encryption and access logs
